Redux Example for Android

Welcome to the Redux Example for Android project! This repository provides a simple example of how to implement the Redux architecture pattern in an Android application using Kotlin.

Overview

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, and this example adapts its principles to the Android platform. By using Redux, you can manage the state of your Android app in a more predictable and manageable way, especially as your app grows in complexity.

Features

	•	State Management: Centralized state management using Redux principles.
	•	Unidirectional Data Flow: Ensures predictable behavior by maintaining a single source of truth for the application state.
	•	Separation of Concerns: Clean architecture that separates UI logic, business logic, and state management.

Usage

This example project is designed to help you understand the basics of Redux on Android. You can explore the codebase to see how actions, reducers, and the store work together to manage application state.

Key Components:

	•	Actions: Represent the intent to change the state.
	•	Reducers: Pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state.
	•	Store: Holds the application state and allows the state to be updated through dispatching actions.
